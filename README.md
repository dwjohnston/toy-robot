This is my solution to the Toy Robot challenge

To run with a file: 

`npm start path-to-file`

To run in development

`npm run start:dev`

(Just runs against the file in `test_data`, with a live reload). 

Tests: 

`npm test` to run them all once. 

or `npm run test:watch` to run them with live reload.
